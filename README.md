# What's Up Ya'll

My name's Ricardo Herrera and I am a 3rd year aerospace engineering student at Iowa State University. Right now I have created this profile and repository for my AER E 361 class at school, but I hope in the future to use GitHub for my own personal projects. 

At school I'm also pursuing a minor in computer science and I hope to use my CS skills and my aerospace knowledge to work in the avionics field of the aerospace industry. I'm hoping that my college courses will allow me to develop my coding skills and understand its applications in the aerospace industry. Well... that's still a couple years away so in the meantime here's a little bit more about me:

* *Hobbies*
   - During quarentine, I picked up bike riding pretty seriously after getting a running injury. During my free time I like to go on long distance bike rides and I'm actually looking into finally doing my first bike trip this coming summer with RAGBRAI. If I can get a spot and I don't end up getting an internship far from the midwest, you'll find me biking across the whole state of Iowa.

* *What I'm working on*
   - Currently I'm workiong on wiritng Python and C code for my aerospace computational techniques class. Eventually in the course, I'll be working on a group project with an arduino and other hardware.
